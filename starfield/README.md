# Starfield Simulators in FORTH

Source code for several FORTH-based implementations of starfield simulator, initially inspired by @BreakIntoProg on Twitter.

## Jupiter Ace

`starfield.fs` is a Forth source code that can be typed into the Jupiter Ace or Minstrel 4th. Once entered, run with `STARS`.

## ZX Spectrum

`starfield_zxs_aber.fs` is a FORTH source file that can be used with Abersoft FORTH on the ZX Spectrum. To load and run, type:

`LOADT`
`1 LOAD`
